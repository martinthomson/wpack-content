The server would then have to offer all of the options that match for the transfer to complete successfully.\r\n\r\nIt should be fairly easy to work out a number of bits that might disambiguate sufficiently.  Especially given that the transfer target URL scopes the request considerably.  If you were prepared to place more load on the URL, as little as a single octet could be enough to disambiguate multiple content versions.",
